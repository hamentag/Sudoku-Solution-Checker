Sudoku is a logic puzzle played on a 9x9 grid subdivided into 9 3x3 subgrids. The player is presented with a partially filled puzzle and must complete it following these rules:
    - Each column must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats).
    - Each row must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats).
    - Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1-9 (no repeats).
In this program, the given sudoku solution is hard coded. It provides two solutions, one is true and the other is false. However, in the next program, the solutions are given by the user in an HTML file.
